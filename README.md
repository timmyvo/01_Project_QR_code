# 01_Project_QR_code
My first journey with Python. Short and Sweet.

Idea: An app to creat a random password with QR code in order to scan easily with phone or tablet. 

Steps to do:
  1. Search how to make a random strings with Python.
  2. How to add options for input password length and some info relating those length.
  3. How to turn that string into a qrcode and export and QR.png
  4. How to make a simple GUI in order to easily present for other user. 
  5. Compile the Python code into .exe so everyone can run on windows. 

I am happy to receive any comments in order to make my code shoter and smarter. 
Cheers.
